# Mindustry Assembly

-   Also called `MASM`
-   The file extension for `MASM` is `.masm`

## File Structures

-   Any sequence of characters given in single-quotes and monospace font denote a terminal sequence;
-   Special terminal sequences that needs specification are given in angle brackets: <â€¦>;
-   Normal parentheses are used sparingly to specify priority between other operations;
-   A sequence of rules `A` and `B`: `(A B)`;
-   Choice between rules `A` and `B`: `(A | B)`;
-   Optional use of rule A: `[A]`;
-   Repetition of rule `A`: `{A}`.
